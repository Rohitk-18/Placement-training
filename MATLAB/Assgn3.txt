%1. Create a function circle_area(r) that takes the radius as input and returns the area and circumference.
%Soln :
function [area, circumference] = circle_area(r)
% circle_area calculates the area and circumference of a circle
% Input: r - radius of the circle
% Output: area, circumference

    area = pi * r^2;
    circumference = 2 * pi * r;
end


%2. Create a vector with 20 random integers between 1 and 100. Find and display: 
● All numbers greater than 50 
● The number of even numbers in the vector
%Soln :
% Generate 20 random integers from 1 to 100
vec = randi([1, 100], 1, 20);

% Display numbers greater than 50
disp('Numbers greater than 50:');
disp(vec(vec > 50));

% Count even numbers
even_count = sum(mod(vec, 2) == 0);
fprintf('Number of even elements: %d\n', even_count);


%3. Write a loop to keep summing random numbers between 0 and 1 until the total exceeds 10. Display the number of iterations it took.
%Soln :
% Keep summing random numbers until total exceeds 10

total = 0;
iterations = 0;

while total <= 10
    total = total + rand();  % Add random number between 0 and 1
    iterations = iterations + 1;
end

fprintf('It took %d iterations to exceed a total of 10.\n', iterations);
